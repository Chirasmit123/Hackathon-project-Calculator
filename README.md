# Hackathon-project-Calculator

## About
This project is a basic mathematics calculator that has been made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the three fundamentals of web-development. In this website, you can perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can perform these calculations using whole numbers only. The website also contains links to other resources, which overall makes it a site which you can be totally dependent on for any kind of calculations that you want to perform. 

## Tech-Stack Used:
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Motivation:
Since this is a common project that every newbie does when he/she enters into the world of web-development, and also since it's one of the popular basic projects that newbies do, I decided to test my skills by choosing this to be my first ever web-development project.

### How these 7 days of codathon helped me in this project?
I would say that I could make this project only because of the resources that these 7 days of Codathon provided me with. I never had an experience of learning things from written resources, like I had experience but I would say it was never a good one. But the resources provided in these 7 days consist of not only written documents but also interactive videos related to the topic, which increased interest to learn more.
